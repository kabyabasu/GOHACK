Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. Although AML is a relatively rare disease, accounting for roughly 1.2% of cancer deaths in the United States,its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages. Here we tried to predict drug response of the the Genomics feature of the patient. If we can successfully predict the response before chemotherapy we may save few more life. We have used dataset from TCGA portal https://cancergenome.nih.gov/ However for feature selection we selected only those genes which are well published in scietific literature published.
